//GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
//WHEN I search for a city
//THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
//WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
//THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
//WHEN I view the UV index
//THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
//WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
//THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
//WHEN I click on a city in the search history
//THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
